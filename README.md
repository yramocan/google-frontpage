# Google Frontpage

This is my recreation of the Google front page. It is made with vanilla HTML/CSS. You can view it by downloading the source files as a .zip archive with the "Download ZIP" button above or use `git clone https://github.com/yramocan/google-frontpage.git` to your desired directory.

Once you've extracted the files from the archive, `cd` into the `google-frontpage` directory and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. Then navigate to `localhost:8000` in your browser. Alternatively, open the `index.html` file in your browser and view the page there.
